# Chess Game

### About the Project

I developed this chess game project as a means to hone my coding skills in C++ and practice object-oriented programming principles. The primary objective was to reinforce my understanding of fundamental concepts while also adhering to good coding practices such as DRY and SOLID principles. Throughout the development process, I strived to maintain clean, readable code and ensure that the implementation aligned with essential object-oriented coding practices like abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance.
